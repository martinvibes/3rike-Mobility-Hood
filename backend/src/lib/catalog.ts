// Off-chain enrichment for tricycle assets, keyed by the on-chain `vehicleId`.
// The chain is the source of truth for ownership + financials; this only adds
// presentation data (imagery, copy, location) plus the real revenue model that
// grounds investor projections.
//
// Revenue model: a rider pays `weeklyRepayment` USD/week toward owning the
// tricycle. Of that, `investorWeekly` USD/week is distributed to the asset's
// shareholders as yield (the rest repays principal + platform/maintenance).
// Projected APR is DERIVED from these on top of the on-chain asset price, so
// the numbers reflect real cash flow rather than an arbitrary rate.
